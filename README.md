# Resume Generator using Vite + TypeScript + React

A modern, responsive resume builder application built with React and TypeScript.  

Note: This app doesn't generate resume, my purpose was to practice React 
and specifically state-lifting. I didn't focus on CSS so adding too many details 
may lead to overflow. I'll be looking forward to your feedback! You can always find
